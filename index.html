<p>I am a Web Development Professional with Highly Developed Sales/Customer Service and Marketing Skills.</p>
<p>I live in San Francisco and I like so much of what the Bay Area has to offer. I'm an avid bicycle commuter, hiker, weightlifter, bodyworker, nutrition enthusiast, and last but definitely not least: a Ruby on Rails coder. In addition to my past experience with HTML, CSS, Photoshop and Illustrator, I can find my way around the full Rails stack and work a little magic on the front end, build out an authentication, make a contact form, set up an online store, or do an AWS deployment. I enjoy pairing and working on a team.</p>
